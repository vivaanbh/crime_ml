# crime_ml
This is a research project that I undertook as an extension of my previous project on the implications of the pandemic on crime. It explores the applications of machine learning techniques and big data tools to make predictions/inferences surrounding crime. 

The aim of the project is to introduce a simple example of how ML techniques can be used to make inferences surrounding crime that can be helpful to various stakeholders like the police for resource allocation, government to make policies, for political campaigns etc. 

Contents:

- Data: Chicago crime data from 2001 to present
- Cleaning: using pandas and numpy to clean, merge, add and remove data
- Descriptive Stats, Visualisations & Regressions: to understand the data, and relationships between arrests and various features.
- Machine Learning: Show the model using GNB, RF, DT, & Logit. We show the top features with the most information gain and choose the best model. 

Please give the paper a read to understand the project and its findings better!
